</p>
<p>
When her father was promoted and transferred from Haryana to Hyderabad,
she took up badminton at the age of eight to express herself, as she did not know the 
local language well enough to socialise with other kids.[24] Her parents played badminton
 for a number of years. Her mother, Usha Rani, was a state level badminton player in Haryana.
  Nehwal took up badminton to fulfill her mother's dream of becoming a national level badminton player,
  while her sister played volleyball.[21] Her father, who was among the top players in the university 
  circuit, used his provident fund to invest in good badminton training for her.[23] After moving to Hyderabad 
  in 1998, she was enrolled in a karate class by her parents, which she continued for a year and earned a brown belt.
</p>
<p>
