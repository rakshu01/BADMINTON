       ranking of no. 2 in April 2017.[8]
</P>
<P>
Sindhu broke into the top 20 of the BWF World Rankings in September 2012, at the
 age of 17.[9] She has won a total of five medals at the BWF World Championships 
 and is only the second woman after China's Zhang Ning ever to win five or more 
 singles medals in the competition. She represented India at the 2016 Summer Olympics 
 (Rio), where she became the first Indian badminton player to reach the Olympic final. 
 She won the silver medal after losing out to Spain's Carolina Marín.[10] She made her 
 second consecutive Olympic appearance at the 2020 Summer Olympics (Tokyo) and won a bronze
  medal, becoming the first-ever Indian woman to win two Olympic medals.[11][12]

   fourth-highest civilian award, the Padma Shri, and third-highest civilian award, the Padma Bhushan.
</P>
<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>
Pusarla Venkata Sindhu was born and brought up in Hyderabad, India to P. V. Ramana and 
P. Vijaya.[5][17] Ramana's ancestors belong to Eluru district of Andhra Pradesh and later
 moved to Guntur.[18][19] Ramana was an employee of the Indian Railways and was born in Nirmal. 
 Vijaya hails from Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh.[18][20] Sindhu and her family regularly offer prayers 
 to their family deity in Ratnalammakunta village of Eluru district.
</p>
<P>
Both her parents have been national level volleyball players. Her father, Ramana and was a 
member of the Indian volleyball team that won the bronze medal in the 1986 Seoul Asian Games, 
received the Arjuna Award in 2000 for his contribution to the sport.[24] Sindhu lives in Hyderabad.
 She was educated at Auxilium High School[25] and at St. Ann's College for Women, Hyderabad.
 Though her parents played professional volleyball, she chose badminton over it because she drew
  inspiration from the success of Pullela Gopichand, the 2001 All England Open Badminton Champion.
   She eventually started playing badminton from the age of eight.[24] She first learned the basics of 
   the sport with the guidance of Mehboob Ali at the badminton courts of the Indian Railway Institute of
    Signal Engineering and Telecommunications in Secunderabad. Soon after, she joined Pullela Gopichand's
     Gopichand Badminton Academy.[27] While profiling her career, a correspondent with The Hindu wrote:
</P>
<P>

"The fact that she reports on time at the coaching camps daily, traveling a distance
 of 56 km from her residence, is perhaps a reflection of her willingness to complete
  her desire to be a good badminton player with the required hard work and commitment."
</P>
<P>
Gopichand seconded this correspondent's opinion when he said that "the most striking 
feature in Sindhu's game is her attitude and the never-say-die spirit."[28] After joining
 Gopichand's badminton academy, Sindhu won several titles. In the under-10 years category, 
 she won the fifth Servo All India ranking championship in the doubles category and the singles 
 title at the Ambuja Cement All India ranking. In the under-13 years category, she won the singles
 title at the Sub-juniors in Pondicherry, doubles titles at the Krishna Khaitan All India Tournament 
 IOC All India Ranking, the Sub-Junior Nationals and the All India Ranking in Pune. She also won the 
 under-14 team gold medal at the 51st National State Games in India.[24] She later parted company with 
 Gopichand and went on to train with South Korean coach Park Tae-sang.[29][30] Now she is currently coached 
 by Muhammad Hafiz Hashim.
